# Git architecture

+ **`origin`**	= stands for the *remote repository*. When we use `git push -u origin local_branch`, it tells the system that we want to push our local branch to the remote repository. Usually there is one default remote repository and origin represents this default repository.
  + If you don’t like "origin", you can rename it
```{bash}
#  rename origin it by using 
git remote rename origin new_name
```

+ **`branch`**	branch is a like a fork in the history of a repository. One branch represents an independent line of development, like a fork teeth.
```{bash}
#  to check which branches I have  
git branch -a
    # * master
    #   page_col
    #   remotes/origin/master
```
+ **`master`**	master is a branch, the default branch, the main branch, and it’s always there.

+ **`HEAD`**	= the currently active branch (the checked out one). Each repository only has one current branch, hence one HEAD as well.
  + **`Detached HEAD`** happens when a checkout command is applied to a specific historical commit, tag or remote branch.

```{bash}
#  to check where the HEAD of a repository is pointing to
cat .git/HEAD
    # ref: refs/heads/master
```

+ **`index`**	index is the proposed next commit, also called staging area. 

# Git commands

See @fig-git_wfl 

+ `git status`	    = View the state of working directory and staging area
+ `git add`       = Stage changes for next commit 
+ `git commit`    = Commit the staged snapshot to the local repository    
+ `git push`      = Upload local repository content to a remote repository
  + 4 TEAM: it makes your local changes publicly available in a remote repository.  
+ `git clone`     = Copies an entire remote repository down to your local machine, setting up a cloned version and checks out the default branch (generally master)
  + this action is done only once.
+ `git fetch`     = Download content from remote repository, but doesn’t force the merge 
  + 4 TEAM: if a developer has pushed changes to a remote branch, those changes will be pulled down to your repository whenever fetch is performed.
     + Note: fetch won't automatically merge any changes, only update references!
+ `git merge`     = Join two branches together
+ `git pull`      = Combo of git fetch and git merge

## See differences b/w commits 

```{bash}
# diff between 2 latest commits (1 on branch) only in files I care 
git diff dc87ae c86edffc16 "*.qmd"

#(To view diff between next commit (HEAD) and parent commit (SHA 682bc))
git diff dc87ae..  
git diff dc87ae^..HEAD  '***.qmd' #ORQ
git diff dc87ae..HEAD   #OR

# b/w old commit on branch and HEAD 
git diff 693e61^..HEAD

```
