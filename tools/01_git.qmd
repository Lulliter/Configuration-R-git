+ `highlight + [alt + drag]` --> to edit at begin of each lines

# Git architecture

...

+ **`origin`**	= origin stands for the *remote repository*. When we use `git push -u origin local_branch_name`, it tells the system that we want to push our local branch to the remote repository. Usually there is one default remote repository and origin represents this default repository.
  + If you don’t like this name, you can rename it by using 
  `git remote rename origin new_name`

+ **`HEAD`**	= the last commit of the active/current branch. Each repository only has one current branch, hence one HEAD as well. If you want to check where the HEAD of a repository is pointing to, run `cat .git/HEAD`

+ **`Detached HEAD`** happens when a checkout command is applied to a specific historical commit, tag or remote branch.

+ **`master`**	master is a branch, the default branch, the main branch, and it’s always there.

+ **`branch`**	branch is a like a fork in the history of a repository. One branch represents an independent line of development, like a fork teeth.

+ **`index`**	index is the proposed next commit, also called staging area. 

# Git commands

See @fig-git_wfl 

+ `git status`	    = View the state of working directory and staging area
+ `git add`       = Stage changes for next commit 
+ `git commit`    = Commit the staged snapshot to the local repository    
+ `git push`      = Upload local repository content to a remote repository
  + 4 TEAM: it makes your local changes publicly available in a remote repository.  
+ `git clone`     = Copies an entire remote repository down to your local machine, setting up a cloned version and checks out the default branch (generally master)
  + this action is done only once.
+ `git fetch`     = Download content from remote repository, but doesn’t force the merge 
  + 4 TEAM: if a developer has pushed changes to a remote branch, those changes will be pulled down to your repository whenever fetch is performed.
     + Note: fetch won't automatically merge any changes, only update references!
+ `git merge`     = Join two branches together
+ `git pull`      = Combo of git fetch and git merge

# Branches

## Create & checkout a branch

```{bash}
# 1/2 create b
git branch page_col #create a new branch named "page_col"

# 2/2 then switch to b
git checkout page_col

# or 1+2/2 CREATE + SWITCH BRANCHES
git checkout -b page_col  
```

Now I see   
![Git chekout branch](./img_tools/ck_branch.png){#fig-git_ck_b}

##  Make changes in branch
I add a page to the site

# Collaboration

1. I create a test GH account **lula-test**  (associated to l__a__a@icloud.com)

2. I clone in  `/Users/testuser/GH_test/nerd_help` this repository "nerd-help" I own as **Lulliter** and (from there (I indicated that **lula-test** is a collaborator)


```{bash}
# positioned in parent folder /Users/testuser/GH_test/
git clone https://github.com/Lulliter/nerd_help.git
cd nerd_help
```

**Rules** 

+ THE MASTER BRANCH SHOULD ALWAYS BE DEPLOYABLE
  + you create new branches for new features and merge them into Master when they’re completed. 

  + It’s also important when collaborating that your team picks features that don’t have overlapping code. 

3. Here I create a new branch **colors_page** and I go there 

```{bash}
#  I create a new branch to add a color.qmd page and switch there 
git checkout -b colors_page 

# verify this with the command:
git branch
```


  + "checkout” is used to switch between branches. Adding the “-b” and a name at the end creates a new branch and then moves into that new branch for us.

In the branch, the collabrorator

+ makes some changes ...
+ add + commit + push 

3.b Wait 

Even if I am in the collaborator GH, lookg like the remote is considered the owner GH 

```{bash}
git remote -v         
# origin  https://github.com/Lulliter/nerd_help.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/Lulliter/nerd_help.git (push)
```
so I must change te origin in the collaborator GH


```{bash}
git remote set-url origin  https://github.com/lula-test/nerd_help.git
```
